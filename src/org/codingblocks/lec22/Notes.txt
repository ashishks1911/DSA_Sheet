Merge Sort and Quick sort both are based on Divide and Conquer algorithm.

Divide and Conquer Algorithm steps :
      1. Divide the problem into sub problems
      2. Solve sub problems using recursion
      3. combine the results of sub problem

Divide :
                      {7 , 5, 1, 4, 3}
                       /            \
                  {7, 5, 1}        {4, 3}
                  /       \         /   \
              {7, 5}      {1}     {4}   {3}
              /    \
            {7}    {5}

Arrays.sort is a hybrid algorithm.
